# ecf-reaction-index
Everything pertaining to methods for ECF reaction index scoring and visualization of clinical data during ECF vaccine trials.

The calculations here are derived from the following two papers:

1. Rowlands, G.J.; Musoke, A.J.; Morzaria, Subhash P.; Nagda, S.M.; Ballingall, Keith T.; McKeever, Declan J. 2000. **A statistically derived index for classifying East Coast fever reactions in cattle challenged with _Theileria parva_ under experimental conditions.** _Parasitology_ 120: 371–381 [CGSpace link](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/129556)
2. Rowlands, G.J.; Musoke, A.J.; Nene, V.A., Bishop, R.P.; Nagda, S.M.; Morzaria, S.P. 2001. **Application of principal component analysis for classifying East Coast fever reactions in cattle challenged with _Theileria parva_.** Proceedings of the _Society for Veterinary Epidemiology and Preventime Medicine_, Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands, 2001: pp.57–66 [CGSpace link](https://hdl.handle.net/10568/50185)

In addition to the above-mentioned two publications, we used unpublished (== ILRI internal) handover notes written by John Rowlands and Sonal Nagda on 09 November 2004, as well as their original design of an MS Access database for the calculation of ECF reaction indices.
